                        this is my little website. i put things here. hi
                        <br>
                        nothing here is permanent. i have a thousand different thoughts and fixations and stories and holes in my brain. i'll put something here and forget about it. it happens, it's fine
                        <br>
                        this is also an exercise in learning. thank you for visiting ^_^
